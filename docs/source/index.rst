Welcome to QuLTRA's documentation
==================================

QuLTRA is an open-source Python library for the analysis of superconducting circuits that include both lumped elements (capacitors, inductors, Josephson junctions, resistors) and distributed components (such as coplanar waveguides and CPW couplers).

The library provides tools to compute:

-Eigenfrequencies of the circuit modes,

-Dissipation rates, including coupling to external lines,

-The cross-Kerr matrix, describing the nonlinear interactions between modes.

QuLTRA is designed to support fast, layout-independent modeling in the early design stages, before full electromagnetic simulations.

Authors
==========

QuLTRA has been developed by Simona Zaccaria and Antonio Gnudi at the University of Bologna, and it is currently maintained by Simona Zaccaria.
